## Version 1.4.4 (July 17, 2019)
Added an i at the top-left (NSInfo)

Deleted ... in hide in the menubar because there's also a root one in the menu bar (...)

Added an apology text and a made with text
I should have done 1.5 instead of 1.4.4, I might do that after archiving (I like looking back)

A few other things (I think), can't remember

Added readme.md (a markdown file)
Added this changelog.md (another markdown file :roll:)
